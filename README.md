# Scaffolding Unit Tests in ASP.NET Core

This repository is a sample for my blog post about [Scaffolding Unit Tests in ASP.NET Core](https://mondaylabs.xyz/scaffolding-unit-tests-in-asp.net-core/).

## Key features

This sample demonstrates creating ASP.NET project and writing unit tests that validate the features in that project. This project is about creating a simple Hogwarts House Sorting app, similar to the Sorting Hat in the Harry Potter series. The main feature of this app is that users can receive their house assignment after they submit their name.

## Restore and test

To run the tests, navigate to the *HouseSorting.Tests* directory and type the following commands:

```
dotnet test
```

`dotnet test` builds both projects and runs all of the configured tests.
